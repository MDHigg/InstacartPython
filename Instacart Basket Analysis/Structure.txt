01 Project Management: This folder will contain all the documentation related to the project; for instance, a project plan with timeline, a budget, any signed contracts, and, in general, any important paperwork related to the project’s organization.

02 Data (Deleted): This folder will contain any data sets used in the project. Within this folder, have two additional subfolders: “Original Data”, for storing the raw data sets, and “Prepared Data”, for storing any manipulated data sets.

03 Scripts: This folder will contain your scripts or notebooks. These should follow an intuitive naming system; for instance, an abbreviation of the project name along with the step in the process it represents. One possible name for the notebook you’ll create in this Exercise could be “4.2 IC Importing libraries and Python data types.” This way, you’ll know what the notebook contains, that it’s for the Instacart project (IC), and that it represents the “Achievement 4, Exercise 2” step of the process.

04 Analysis: This folder will contain all the results you produce throughout your analysis. You might want to create subfolders for the different deliverables you produce—for example “Visualizations,” “Test files,” and “Reports.”

05 Sent to client: This folder will contain all the final deliverables you’ve sent to the client. These should be the latest versions of any results you’ve produced and should be kept up to date.
